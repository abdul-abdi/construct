# Real Estate & Construction Landing Page - Project Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a highly modern, unique, and immersive landing page for a real estate and construction company. The tech stack specified is Next.js, React, TypeScript (assumed from `tsconfig.json`), Framer Motion for animations, and Shadcn UI for UI components. The key requirement is to move beyond conventional designs, incorporating significant animations, especially scroll-driven effects, to create a "cool" and engaging user experience. The project requires deep thinking about design and leveraging modern web capabilities.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

*   **Balancing Uniqueness and Usability**: Creating a novel experience without sacrificing clarity, navigation ease, and conveying the company's core message and services effectively.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Heavy use of animations, particularly scroll-based ones and potentially 3D elements or complex transitions, can significantly impact load times and rendering performance. Careful optimization techniques (lazy loading, code splitting, efficient animation logic, image optimization) will be crucial.
*   **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that complex layouts and animations translate well across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) is challenging but essential.
*   **Library Integration**: Seamlessly combining Framer Motion's animation capabilities with Shadcn UI's component structure while maintaining a unique, non-standard visual identity derived from Shadcn.
*   **Content Strategy**: Defining the necessary content (Hero, Services, Portfolio/Projects, About, Contact) and determining innovative ways to present it.
*   **Design Concepts**: Exploring potential unique directions:
    *   Interactive 3D models of buildings/sites.
    *   Parallax scrolling effects contrasting blueprints/construction phases with finished projects.
    *   Animated timelines visualizing project lifecycles or company history.
    *   Dynamic backgrounds using subtle animations or video.
    *   Non-traditional navigation patterns.

## High-level Task Breakdown

The development will proceed step-by-step, focusing on one section/feature at a time, incorporating TDD principles where practical (especially for utility functions or complex state logic).

1.  **Project Setup & Initial Structure**: *Completed.*
2.  **Core Layout & Navigation**: *Completed.*
3.  **Hero Section Design & Animation**:
    *   Conceptualize and design a unique and engaging hero section. *(Started with a basic concept)*.
    *   Implement the structure using appropriate Shadcn UI components (e.g., `div`, `h1`, `p`, `Button`) and custom styling. *(Done)*.
    *   Add initial Framer Motion entry animations (e.g., text fade-in/slide-up, background element transitions). *(Done)*.
    *   *Success Criteria*: Hero section renders with static content matching the design concept. Entry animations trigger on load.
4.  **Services Section Design & Interaction**:
    *   Design an interactive way to present company services (e.g., animated cards, accordion, scroll-reveal elements).
    *   Implement the section structure and content.
    *   Add Framer Motion animations for hover effects or scroll-triggered reveals.
    *   *Success Criteria*: Services section renders content. Defined animations/interactions work as expected.
5.  **Portfolio/Projects Section Design & Interaction**:
    *   Design a visually compelling showcase for projects (e.g., parallax image gallery, interactive grid, animated carousel).
    *   Implement the section structure with placeholder project data.
    *   Add animations and interactions (e.g., hover zooms, filter animations, modal transitions).
    *   *Success Criteria*: Portfolio section renders placeholder projects. Defined animations/interactions work as expected.
6.  **About/Team Section Design & Interaction**:
    *   Design a section to convey company story or team information (e.g., horizontal scrolling timeline, staggered element reveals).
    *   Implement the section structure and content.
    *   Add relevant animations.
    *   *Success Criteria*: About section renders content. Defined animations/interactions work as expected.
7.  **Contact Section & Form**:
    *   Design and implement the contact section.
    *   Utilize Shadcn UI form components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `Form`) for the contact form.
    *   Add subtle input focus/validation animations. Implement basic form handling (client-side for now).
    *   *Success Criteria*: Contact section renders. Form elements are styled using Shadcn UI. Basic client-side interaction is present.
8.  **Scroll-Based Animations Integration**:
    *   Implement scroll-triggered animations across multiple sections using Framer Motion's `useScroll`, `motion.div` with `whileInView`, or similar techniques. Focus on smooth, performant execution.
    *   Refine existing animations to integrate with scroll progression.
    *   *Success Criteria*: Elements animate into view or react to scroll position as designed across different sections. Animations are reasonably smooth.
9.  **Responsiveness & Cross-Browser Testing**:
    *   Adapt layout, components, and animations for tablet and mobile breakpoints using Tailwind CSS's responsive modifiers.
    *   Test thoroughly on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and device sizes (using browser dev tools and real devices if possible).
    *   *Success Criteria*: The landing page is fully responsive and functions correctly across target devices and browsers. Animations remain smooth.
10. **Performance Optimization**:
    *   Analyze performance using Lighthouse and browser dev tools.
    *   Optimize images (format, compression, size).
    *   Implement lazy loading for images and components below the fold.
    *   Review animation logic for potential bottlenecks. Code splitting via Next.js dynamic imports.
    *   *Success Criteria*: Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) are high (e.g., 90+). Page feels fast and responsive.
11. **Final Review & Deployment Prep**:
    *   Conduct a final code review and cleanup.
    *   Perform end-to-end testing of all features and interactions.
    *   Prepare necessary configurations for deployment (e.g., environment variables).
    *   *Success Criteria*: Codebase is clean, all features work as intended, site is ready for deployment.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

*   **Blocker (Task 1):** Missing `tailwind.config.js` (or `.ts`/`.mjs`) file. The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 (`^4.0.0`), which might require a different configuration approach for Shadcn UI compared to v3. The `src/components` directory is also missing. **Resolved:** Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based config (`@theme` in `globals.css`), which is present. Created `src/components/ui` directory.
*   **Need Decision:** How to proceed with Tailwind configuration? **Resolved:** Followed Shadcn v4 docs. No JS config needed. Ran research (Option 3).
*   Installed `framer-motion` successfully.
*   Task 1 (Project Setup & Initial Structure) is complete.
*   Task 2 (Core Layout & Navigation) is complete.
    *   Created `Header`, `Footer` components.
    *   Integrated them into the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
    *   Cleaned up `src/app/page.tsx`.
*   **Request:** Please run `npm run dev` and verify the basic layout (Header, Footer, placeholder content on page). **User Verified.**
*   Added basic `Hero` component (`src/components/layout/Hero.tsx`) with simple Framer Motion entry animations.
*   Integrated `Hero` component into `src/app/page.tsx`.
*   Added Shadcn `Button` component (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`).
*   **Request:** Please run `npm run dev` again. Verify that the Hero section (with text "Building Dreams, Constructing Futures") appears below the Header and above the Footer, and that the elements animate in smoothly on load. Once verified, I can mark Task 3 as complete (for its initial scope).

## Lessons

*   **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router likely), React, TypeScript, Framer Motion, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Goal**: Unique, modern, immersive landing page with heavy animation use, prioritizing aesthetics and engagement.
*   **Process**: Follow TDD where applicable. Report progress after each task milestone. Request user verification before marking tasks complete. Planner confirms final project completion.
*   **Debugging**: Include useful debug info in program output.
*   **File Handling**: Read files before editing.
*   **Security**: Run `npm audit` if vulnerabilities appear during installs.
*   **Git**: Confirm before using `--force` commands.
*   **Design**: Balance uniqueness with usability and performance. Ensure responsiveness.
*   **Optimization**: Focus on performance from the start due to animation complexity.
*   **Tailwind v4 Config**: Tailwind v4 often doesn't require a `tailwind.config.js` file, relying instead on `@theme` directives within the main CSS file (`globals.css` for Next.js/Shadcn). The `shadcn@latest init` command supports this.
*   **Shadcn Init**: If `components.json` exists, `shadcn init` will stop. Setup seems mostly complete if `globals.css` contains v4 `@theme` config.
*   **Shadcn CLI**: Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` instead of the deprecated `shadcn-ui`. Need to use `--legacy-peer-deps` with React 19 + npm currently.
